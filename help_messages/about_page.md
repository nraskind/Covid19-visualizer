### The Covid19 data tracking app you see was created by Naum Raskind and Melissa Bush as a project for a University of Michigan Bioinformatics class, BIOINF 527. The purpose of this project is to help identify trends in the impact of Covid19 with respect to factors such as race, sex, and age. The app uses Covid19 data pulled from the CDC weekly to support an interactive US map, as well as graphical options for side by side comparisons of data. All data was retrieved from the [CDC Official Website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/)
